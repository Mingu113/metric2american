# What and why
This is just a fun (?) project I made to get know better of enum in C++. Not efficent, not good, I don't even know why I made this.
But hey, I tried, I guess?

# How to use
The program will take argument when called from CLI and will turn into length of objects. Currently only 1 argument to be functional.
**example:** metric2american 1234

Currently there are 1km (11 American football field), 1m (1 M16A4), 1cm (1 standard 1/4 US staple).

It currently only convert length, and is only able to use argument when called from CLI.

# Planning 
I am planning to make it able to function both when called from CLI or when run the executable file. It's also able to handle many argument and is not tied to one. 
I am planning to use stack instead so it could be better.
It should not take much time or be a big problem, I don't have time, knowledge and motivation is the problem.
