# metric2american
# What and why
This is just a fun (?) project I made to get know better of C++. Not efficent, not good, I don't even know why I made this.
But hey, I tried, I guess?

# How to use
The program will take argument when called from CLI and will turn into length of objects. You can input multiple number when call the program.
**example:** metric2american 1234 10000

Currently there are 1km (11 American football field), 1m (1 M16A4), 1cm (1 standard 1/4 US staple).
